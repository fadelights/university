# University Projects
Interesting projects I completed as a student @ AUT.

During my time at Amirkabir University of Technology, I did a variety of
projects on different subjects for different courses; some were quite
interesting, others not as much---This repo is meant  to be a compilation
of all the interesting ones.

Each folder at the root of this repository contains a separate project, 
each with their own respective `README.md` explaining the project.
