# Summary
Certainly one of the projects I am most proud of, even if it is a buggy mess -- 
this project is my first attempt at offering my knowledge to the field
I am most passionate about: video games. 

The goal is to create an intelligent system for artificial agents in 
games so that they may behave, well, more intelligently.

- The full description of the concept for this project is written in `proposal.pdf`
- The full report and documentation on the implementation details is brought in `report.pdf`
